[Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-a-cape/ohkgmmldhbadfleajjafdeahmakbbcpi)

Open source extension which adds a bunch of useful additions to the GitHub UI to make your experience _super_fun (god that was lame).

## Features

The extension is "unopinionated" meaning is up to you to choose which features to enable.

1. [Notifications modal](#notifications-modal)
2. [Add collapsable diffs](#add-collapsable-diffs)
3. [Show All / Hide All buttons](#show-all-hide-all-buttons)
4. [Show the current diff name on the sticky header](#show-the-current-diff-name-on-the-sticky-header)
5. [Add collapsable commits](#add-collapsable-commits)
6. [Toggle contributions by clicking the added/deleted stats](#toggle-contributions-by-clicking-the-addeddeleted-stats)
7. [Show outdated diff comments by default](#show-outdated-diff-comments-by-default)

### Notifications modal

When clicking the notifications bell, instead of accessing the notifications page, it displays a modal with each notification and adds a shortcut to read all of them.

Sadly the GitHub API does not allow reading specific notifications (at least to my knoledge) so accessing one thru the modal will keep it unread

### Add collapsable diffs

Be able to collapse diffs clicking on the header

### Show outdated diff comments by default

Tired of having to click on __ each time you enter a PR? Well not anymore!
This option shows the diff by default
