9. [Highlights the outdated diff icon (the X) on PRs](#highlight-outdated-diff-icon)

### Notifications modal

When clicking the notifications bell, instead of accessing the notifications page, it displays a modal with each notification and adds a shortcut to read all of them.

Sadly the GitHub API does not allow reading specific notifications (at least to my knoledge) so accessing one thru the modal will keep it unread.

### Resizeable splitted diffs

A gray vertical bar is added to each split diff allowing you to drag horizontally each code piece.

Be able to collapse diffs clicking on the header.

### Toggle contributions by clicking the added/deleted stats

If you click the added or deleted colored text, it will toggle that contribution type in the diff.

### Show outdated diff comments by default

Tired of having to click on _Show x comments_ each time you read the PR comments? Well not anymore!
This option shows the diff by default.

_These will be visible by default_
